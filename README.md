# Git Friends 

This was one of the first projects where I accessed an API and mapped users dynamically!

## User Stories
&check;  I can type in a git hub user name and their profile will show up along with their git hub friends.

&check;  I can see the git hub users requested in a card with their profile name and link to their git hub profile.

&check;  Each subsequent search will replace the last round of profile cards.

## Lessons Learned
- Async/Await to make API calls.

- Mapping user profiles.
  
- use State to store objects and arrays.


## Getting Started


1.  npm install
2.  npm run start
3.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
